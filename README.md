Drug solubility differential equation solvers

We are using a python library called scipy to solve these systems of differential equations.

=============

* Mass_Dissoc_dMdrdz.py : (monodisperse) solves dM/dt the 'simple' way with r=r0, then accounting for the fact that dr & dz are functions of dM

Previous versions:
* Mass_Dissoc_v0.py solve dM/dt and dr/dt for homogeneous particle distribution with radius r = r0(M/M0)**1/3
*  formerly z_r_optimized.py :solve dM/dt and dr/dt for homogeneous particle distribution with radius r = r0(M/M0)**1/3
* Mass_Dissoc_v1.py : solve system of (2) particle radii: dM/dt = dM1/dt, dM2/dt
* Mass_Dissoc_v2.py : solve system of 2 with the dr/dt effect
